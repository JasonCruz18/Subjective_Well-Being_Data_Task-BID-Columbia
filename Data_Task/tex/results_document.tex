	\begin{itemize}
		\item Interpret the results. What is the relationship between income and subjective riches? (Max
		100 words).
		
		There is a very weak positive relationship. The coefficient 0.0000927 (significant by p-value) is interpreted as: for each additional monetary unit that the respondent receives, his or her score in aspects of well-being increases by 0.0000927 points. This low value means that there are other determinants other than income that better explain the differences in aspects of well-being (such as health, happiness, etc.). In addition, being a bivariate model without controls, the correlation is weak with a very low R squared, although this is not a dazzling indicator in this analysis, we are practically facing an ad hoc model.
		
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection*{\normalsize{e) Regress (with OLS) subjective riches on income with controls for age, $age^{2}$ (age squared), gender, level of education, and race.}}
	
	\input{"C:/Users/PC/Documents/BID-Columbia/Data Task/tables/tab2.tex"}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Interpret the results. (Max 150 words).
	\end{itemize}

The model has improved since the specification, it is more interesting the relationships of the control variables with subjective riches according to the results. For example, the negative coefficient of age (significant) shows that each additional year represents -0.35 points on the aspects of well-being, while the coefficient of age\_squared shows that at a certain age (many years of life) the respondents value more the aspects of well-being, older adults probably rate well-being aspects higher than young people. Likewise, being a male respondent means scoring the aspects of well-being with 2.57 points more than women. On the other hand, for the most part, the categories of the variables education and race score the aspects of well-being less.

\section*{{\textcolor[rgb]{0.0667, 0.1255, 0.1922}{Question 3}}}

Your PI is giving a presentation to a health-policy audience, and she would like to display a figure that illustrates the relationship between subjective ratings of health, income, and age. She has asked you to produce a single scatterplot that conveys the relationship between all three variables.

	\subsection*{\normalsize{a) List the steps you would take to produce the scatterplot. Remember}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Any individual/average rating data in your plot should be for aspects related to health.
		\item All three variables should be featured in some way on the plot.
		\item The figure should readable, effectively convey the information through visuals, and preferably
		be intuitively understandable to an audience that has limited familiarity with the
		survey and your data set.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection*{\normalsize{b) Produce and save the scatterplot (or if you prefer, up to two proposals for alternative scatterplots).}}
	\subsection*{\normalsize{c) From a policy perspective, understanding the determinants of well-being is an important question. Describe the ways in which your regressions in the previous question and your scatterplot(s) help or do not help answer this question. Think about your proxy for well-being (subjective ratings) as well as the specification of your regressions. (Max 250 words)}}
